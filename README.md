<h1>Convert</h1>

ðŸŽ‰ Finally made it to JavaScript! ðŸš€

After nearly a month of studying the basics of web development, from HTML to CSS, I've finally arrived at JavaScript. Today, I completed my first practical exercise in the Rocketseat course with the Convert project, a tool designed for currency conversion. ðŸ’°âœ¨

It was an amazing experience that not only helped me improve my technical skills but also showed me the outstanding teaching quality of the instructors at this institution. The clarity and depth in their approach makes a huge difference in the learning process. ðŸ”¥ðŸ’¡

Looking forward to tackling more challenging projects! ðŸ’»ðŸ’ª
